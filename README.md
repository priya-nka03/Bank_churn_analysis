**Bank Customer Churn Analysis**

**Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing bank customer data to understand why customers churn and identify patterns that differentiate churners from non-churners using exploratory data analysis (EDA).

**Problem Statement**

What attributes are more common among churners than non-churners?

Can customer churn be predicted using the available variables?

**Tools & Technologies**

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Jupyter Notebook

**Key Insights**

Churn is higher among middle-aged customers (40–50 years) and inactive members, highlighting engagement as a key factor.

Customers with only 1–2 products show higher churn, indicating weaker customer relationships.

Female customers and customers from Germany and France exhibit relatively higher churn.

Low engagement, even with product ownership (e.g., credit cards), increases churn risk.
